THtmlViewer
 * The basic component.
 * THtmlViewer displays single (non-frame) documents.
 * It also forms the basis for the other two components.

TFrameViewer (deprecated)
 * Displays both frame and single HTML documents.
 * TFrameViewer is oriented more for local file system use.

TFrameBrowser
 * Also displays frame and single HTML documents.
 * TFrameBrower is oriented for use with local file systems and toward Internet style protocols and URL usage.
 * Additional code and/or components are generally required to get data from other sources than the local file system.

These components support most of the HTML 3.2 specifications with many
additional popular HTML 4 and 5 enhancements.
Many Cascading Style Sheet properties are also supported.
